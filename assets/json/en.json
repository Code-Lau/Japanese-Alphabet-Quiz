    "hiragana_intro_p2":"Each character, excluding the vowels themselves, represents a consonant followed by a vowel. The characters of the kana do not represent single consonants, so that makes it a syllabic symbol system rather than alphabetic letters. There is only one exception, being ん(n).",
    "hiragana_intro_p3":"Hiragana has 48 characters: 5 of which are vowels and the remaining 42 are consonant-vowel unions. Only one is a singular consonant, the aformentioned ん(n). Following the addition of a dakuten, a voiceless consonant is turned into a voice one. For example, か (ka) turns into が (ga).",

    "kanji_intro":"Kanji are the logographic characters adapted from Chinese script used in Japanese. There are nearly 3,000 kanji used in Japanese names and used in common communication.",
    "kanji_intro_p2":"Individual kanji can be used to write words or morphemes, leading to different pronunciations or readings. The correct reading is determined by contextual cues, the exact meaning of the word and where it's positioned in the sentence.",
    "kanji_intro_p3":"While a lot of kanji may only have one or two meanings, common ones can have up to 10 meanings. This may seem daunting, but the meaning will generally be clear to you given the context of the conversation.",

    "word_intro_p2":"If you went on holiday, at the very least you should be proficient enough to speak phrases that will help you get by. Such as how to order food, how to ask for directions, greetings and basic conversation, and so on.",
